# PDF Presentation Tool

A Dual-monitor presentation tool supporting PDFs, Videos, and Images, featuring phone remote control and a break timer. The Node.js backend serves static files and a WebSocket relay. All rendering runs client-side in the browser.
The official website is available at [PDF Presentation Tool](https://presentations.damianoperri.it)

## Features

- **Dual-monitor presentation** -- Separate presenter view and audience display windows
- **Beamer support** -- Automatic detection of LaTeX Beamer split-mode PDFs (slide + notes)
- **Phone remote control** -- Scan a QR code to control slides from your phone via WebSocket
- **Audience Q&A** -- Display a QR code on the audience screen for attendees to submit anonymous questions
- **Slide Review** -- QR-accessible phone view where the audience can flip back through slides already shown, without ever being able to see ahead ("no spoilers")
- **Break timer** -- Set 5/10/15 min (or custom) breaks with a full-screen countdown on the audience display
- **Laser & Spotlight** -- Use a red laser dot or a yellow spotlight that dims the background, following your mouse
- **Whiteboard annotations** -- Draw directly on slides with multiple colors and line weights
- **Dynamic Zoom** -- Magnify a portion of the slide on the audience screen, following your mouse in real-time
- **Audience progress bar** -- Sleek progress indicator at the bottom of the audience screen
- **Blackout** -- Instantly blank the audience screen
- **Resizable panels** -- Drag splitters to resize all panels (sidebar, slides, notes)
- **Collapsible panels** -- Sidebar, next slide preview, and notes can be independently collapsed
- **Session timer** -- With target duration and visual overtime warning
- **Webcam Bubble** -- Display your webcam in a circular bubble on the audience screen (4 positions)
- **Keyboard shortcuts** -- Full keyboard control for navigation, blackout, fullscreen, and tools
- **PWA** -- Installable as a standalone app with offline support
- **Hi-DPI rendering** -- Crisp slides on Retina and high-DPI displays

## Getting Started

### With Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker compose build && docker compose up -d
```

The app will be available on port 80 inside the container.

### Usage

1. Drag and drop a PDF, or one or more Video/Image files onto the landing screen, or click to browse.
2. The presenter view loads with the current slide, next slide preview, and thumbnails
3. Click **▶ Present** to open the audience window -- drag it to your secondary monitor
4. Use keyboard shortcuts to navigate slides and control the presentation

### Phone Remote

1. Click **Remote** in the bottom bar (or have a phone ready)
2. A QR code appears -- scan it with your phone's camera
3. The phone opens a remote control page with large PREV/NEXT buttons
4. Navigate slides from your phone -- supports touch buttons, swipe gestures, and volume keys (Android)

### Break Timer

1. Click **Break** in the bottom bar
2. Choose a preset duration (5, 10, 15 min) or enter a custom time
3. Click **Start Break** -- a full-screen countdown appears on the audience display
4. Click **Stop Break** to end the break early and return to the current slide

### Audience Q&A

1. Click **Q&A** in the bottom bar
2. A QR code appears on the audience display
3. Attendees scan it to open a Q&A page where they can submit anonymous questions
4. Questions appear in real-time in the presenter's Q&A panel
5. Click the button again to hide the QR code and close the panel

### Slide Review

1. Click **Review** in the bottom bar (PDF presentations only)
2. A QR code appears on the audience display -- students scan it to open a phone-friendly gallery
3. As you advance through the deck, each slide is pushed to connected phones the moment it's first shown
4. Students can tap any slide already shown to view it full-screen and swipe between them -- slides you haven't reached yet are never sent, so there's no way to see ahead
5. If you go back to recap an earlier slide, students keep access to everything already shown (the furthest point reached, not just the current slide)

### Webcam

1. Click **Webcam** in the bottom bar
2. Select your camera from the list and choose a bubble position (top/bottom, left/right)
3. The preview shows your face in a mirrored circular bubble
4. Click **Confirm** to show the bubble to the audience
5. The webcam is automatically hidden during **Blackout** mode to maintain focus

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Right / Down / Space / PgDn | Next slide |
| Left / Up / PgUp | Previous slide |
| Home | First slide |
| End | Last slide |
| B or . | Toggle blackout |
| F | Toggle fullscreen (audience window) |
| L | Toggle Laser Pointer mode |
| S | Toggle Spotlight mode |
| Z | Toggle Zoom mode (mouse-follow) |
| P | Toggle audience progress bar |
| D | Toggle Drawing / Whiteboard mode |
| E | Toggle Eraser (while drawing) |
| C | Clear all drawings (while drawing) |
| 1-5 | Change drawing color |
| + / - | Change drawing thickness |

## Beamer Split-Mode

When a PDF has pages with an aspect ratio greater than 2.2 (double-width), the application automatically activates Beamer mode:

- The **left half** of each page is displayed as the slide (to the audience)
- The **right half** is rendered as speaker notes (in the presenter's notes panel)

No manual configuration is needed.

## Architecture

             | WebSocket
             v
    Node.js Server (server.js)  <---- WebSocket ----  Phone Remote
    Static files + WS relay
    QR code generation
```

Both windows communicate via BroadcastChannel API with a postMessage fallback. Phone remotes connect via WebSocket through the Node.js server. All rendering is done client-side using PDF.js.

## Technical Details

- **Server**: Node.js with Express (static files) + ws (WebSocket relay) + qrcode (QR generation)
- **PDF rendering**: Mozilla PDF.js v3.11.174 (loaded from CDN)
- **Inter-window communication**: BroadcastChannel API with postMessage fallback
- **Phone remote**: WebSocket relay through Node.js server, 64-char session IDs
- **Multi-monitor**: Window Management API (requires HTTPS) with manual fallback
- **Hi-DPI**: Canvas renders at devicePixelRatio resolution with CSS scaling
- **Beamer clipping**: Canvas `clip()` + `translate()` to render half-page regions
- **Laser pointer**: Relative mouse coordinates broadcast from presenter to audience
- **Break timer**: Countdown overlay on audience window with progress bar
- **Webcam**: Captured via `getUserMedia` and streamed via local WebRTC `RTCPeerConnection` over `BroadcastChannel` to bypass cross-window security and autoplay restrictions. Video is mirrored for an intuitive presenter experience.

## Browser Compatibility

Tested on:

- **Chrome / Chromium** -- Full support
- **Firefox** -- Full support
- **Safari** -- Full support (laser pointer may be slightly less smooth)

Note: The Window Management API for automatic screen placement requires HTTPS and is currently supported only in Chromium-based browsers. On other browsers, the audience window opens as a regular popup that can be manually dragged to the secondary monitor.
